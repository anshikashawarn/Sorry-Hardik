        <h3>I am extremely sorry for my behavior. I wish I were more careful with my words. I love you my friend. Please accept my apology for this time.

If I have hurt you with my words or behavior, I am really sorry from the depth of my heart. Can’t stay apart from you. I really am sorry.

I just want you to know that I didn’t do it intentionally and it just happened accidentally. I regret that it ended up like this. I love you, dear friend and I am really very sorry.</h3>
